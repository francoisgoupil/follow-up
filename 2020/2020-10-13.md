## October 13th 2020

### Guillaume (away for this meeting)

* WIP:
    * New API for the plotting functions: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18543 -> might converge pretty soon
    * Huge refactor to properly get prediction with different methods and pos_label: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18589 beneficial to sync code and not get bug around
* Thanks to Olivier for helping in decreasing the number of Guillaume open PRs

### Lucy (not here)
* Would like to finish the PR on CalibratedClassifierCV: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17856
  (there are extensive changes to whole calibration.py file so merge conflicts get confusing)
* Would like help with expanding 'pitfalls' section, in particular what topics to add.
  Suggestions in https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/14081 :

    * 'pipeline' is mentioned several times - but I think the current data leakage section covers this?

    * dummy variable trap

    * Christian mentioned: https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04131 but these seem quite general, doesn't seem to fit?

### Chiara
- NMF initialization: waiting for approval. https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18525
- Triaging sprint: working with Lucy, a board is available https://github.com/scikit-learn-inria-fondation/follow-up/projects/3
- Learning github actions: a fake organization to test workflow is available https://github.com/test4actions

### Alex
* Make progress with Maria (add sample weights to StandardScaler): https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18569

### Gael
* Would like to focus on the MOOC, ironing the edges

### Jérémie
* Kmeans memory leak on windows, not a happy ending... (link coming)
* continue work of Thomas on online matrx factorization with missing values (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18492)
* reviewing NMF (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18525)

### Olivier
* Reviewing the backlog of Guillaume's pull requests
* Progress on reviewing and merging Thomas PRs on consistency checks for features in various modules
* Storing feature names for consistency checks makes it possible implement support for feature names propagation in pipeline without wraping
  the output of transformers in a DF-like container https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/48

### Loïc
* MOOC
  * JupyterBook: https://inria.github.io/scikit-learn-mooc/jupyter-book/
  * remove rendered notebooks
  * advance course Inria Academy (linear models, trees + ensembles, cross-val + metrics)

### For next week
- Guillaume + Lucy + Chiara : Triage
- Loic + Gael: MOOC
- Olivier + Lucy : calibration https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17856 + issue on physical cores in HGBRT
- Jeremie + Chiara: NMF
- Alex + Maria: sample_weights in StandardScaler
