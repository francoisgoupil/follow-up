## September 8th 2020

### Gaël
- A bit of discussion on dictionary learning with Chiara, Thomas Schmitt, and Jérémie on MiniBatch DictLearning, NMF and the link to low-rank matrix factorization
- A bit of thoughts on the random_state SLEP by Nicolas Hug ([SLEP11](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/24)).
  Still trying to convince myself whether or not there are ways to have a reproducible full-entropy chain of execution different than what we currently have

### Alex
- sample_weights in pipeline to move forward ([#18159](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/18159)
  - related to: [SLEP06](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/blob/master/slep006/proposal.rst) (routing sample aligned meta-data)
  - blocker for [#17743](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17743)
- statefull splitters and estimators with random_state to move forward with Nicolas Hug
  ([SLEP11](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/24)).

### Olivier
- Benchmark / perf optim (memory efficiency and speed) for hist gradient boosting trees
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18334
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18341
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18242 (won't be merged in the end)
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/14392 (likely to be merged instead)

    For those having some time please try to run the code snippet benchmark for the two PRs and report speed improvements in comments

- Various reviews / discussions with team members
- Reviewing MOOC PRs (chapter on trees at the moment)

### Chiara
- [#18155](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18155) needs answer (done: thanks Olivier!)
- Benchmarks for MiniBatch NMF [#16948](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16948)
  - Why is CircleCI lint check failing there? flake8 on the file does not do anything and the same linter in Azure does not complain.
    I have removed the file for now in order to have codecov reports.
- Comment in [#5685](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/5685): VisibleDeprecationWarning are worth to fix.
  I will open an issue with example and suggestion for solving (sklearn.utils.fixes to  manage different versions of dependencies).
- From [priorities](https://github.com/scikit-learn-inria-fondation/follow-up/projects/2):
    - Documentation: common pitfalls [#16409](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16409) and
      [#17114](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17114). It would be nice if someone could have a look.
    - Benchmarks: [#9429](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/9429) I'm planning to check Jeremie benchmarks for NMF.

### Guillaume:
- Review some ICE new feature and submitted the following bug fix: [#18359](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18359)
- Took over some stalled PRs: [#18343](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18343),
  [#18262](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18262)
- I would need these 2 PRs to get in: [#18183](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18183),
  [#18114](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18114) to work on my longer term PR.
 
### Jérémie
- Set up benchmark suite [here](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn-benchmarks). The web site is
  [here](http://scikit-learn.org/scikit-learn-benchmarks/#/
- minibatch kmeans memory leak (windows + multi-core) more and more confusing... : check on a machine with more CPUs , check disabling threadpoolctl,
  and OpenBLAS vs MKL (conda-forge)
- will take a look at thomas' first implementation of online dict learning with missing values : we should invite him to next follow-up meeting

### Roman
- Could someone with joblib expertise have a look at the updated version of [17634](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17634)?
   Should be good to merge unless there are some concerns.
