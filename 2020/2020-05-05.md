### Chiara
- No release blogpost for 0.23. Different blogpost on specific features from the Consortium roadmap:
    - kmeans benchmarks (with Jérémie)
    - generalized Linear and Poisson models (with Roman)
    - parallelization with joblib and Dask (with Olivier and Pierre)

### Jérémie
- from the last week:
    - thundersvm & daal4py benchmarks:
        - thundersvm is slower than sklearn in single thread but scales better on multiple cores;
        - daal4py is much faster than sklearn even in single thread.
    - reproduced intel benchmarks from the draft blogpost.
    - documentation on asv benchmark suite in sklearn https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17026 (find a way to run only on specific module)
- TODO: benchmarks KMeans for the foundation blogpost.

### Guillaume
- Reviewing ICE PR ready for next release, to be put in 0.24 milestones (done)
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16619

### Olivier & Pierre
- cloudpickle 1.4.1 released
- Worked with Pierre on loky 2.7.0 release + integration in joblib to fix memory map issues. Still not 100% done but almost: benchmarks to be released in joblib organization.
- Last PR to be finalized and merged before making a joblib release: https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/1045
- scikit-learn side: helped review PR on pd.NA, HTML diagrams, ... + improved examples for Poisson.
- TODO: automate release tarball (if nobody did it already)

### Roman
 - LogisticRegression uses too much memory with sparse data and default parameters (regression in 0.22) https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/17125
 - Cleaning on related projects, scikit-learn contrib would benefit of the same verification.
 - Generalization of linear and Poisson models (preparing blog entry)
 
### Gaël
   - Grant proposal
   - Misc reviews for release
   
### Alex
  - please review Mathurin PR https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17099
  - Maria starts working on https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/3020 (maybe Roman can help?)
