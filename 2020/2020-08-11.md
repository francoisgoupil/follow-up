## August 11th 2020

### Guillaume

* Work mainly around the issue with the scorer. Finally submitted:
    * Improvement of ROC-AUC documentation [#18110](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18110).
      Indeed, there is no bug, but I don't like the API which I find inconsistent :)
    * Solving bug in scorer when passing `pos_label` [#18114](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18114).
      An understandable error message should be raised and it should link to an improved documentation.
    * Remaining PR to show how to pass pos_label: improve documentation, add examples. The User Guide should probably be reorganized.
      More details about how to choose a metric, pros and cons and pitfalls (e.g. pos_label and asymmetric metric with string labels).
      See eg [#15389](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/15389)
* Going back to post cut-off tuning [#16525](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16525).
  Actually, the previous work is really helpful regarding the API (make use of scorer instead of callable and remove parameters).

### Lucy

* Finally have first draft of permutation importance vs SHAP example: [#18139](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18139).
  It could be a good idea to involve in the review people from the Consortium as this was among the priorities of the last
  [Technical Committee](https://scikit-learn.fondation-inria.fr/technical-committee-february-3-2020/) 
* User guide for permutation test score: [#18055](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18055), waiting for a second review.
* PR on plot_calibration_curve [#17443](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17443) 
* PR on CalibratedClassifierCV [#17856](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17856) changes made.

To do:
    * Looking at MOOC. Grammar nitpicks are welcome.
    * Finish Brier score user guide [#18051](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18051)
    * Volounteering for taking care of the score documentation.
    
### Chiara

* Triaging questions in the issue tracker: trying to identify an "official attitude".
  In general the issue tracker is not for usage questions.
  Chiara will take over the PR on Triaging [#17907](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17907) and try to clarify the 'Question'
  issue.
* online NMF : the actual implementation produces very big losses for the online version. Debugging.

### Olivier

* Reviewed Sparse PCA explained variance : [#16255](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16255) but problem is that we do
  not really implement the true Sparse PCA so the traditional way to compute explained variance is not correct.
  See the original issues [#11512](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/11512) and
  [#13127](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/13127)
* Reviewing Guillaume's work on pos_label and scorers and roc_auc docstring
* Reviewing Lucy's work on calibration doc / plot tools / ensemble vs non-ensemble CalibratedClassifierCV
* Read about calibration and Brier's score and ROC curves but still not fully clear about relations to bin-based calibration error
* Reviewing categorical variables for gradient boosting [#16909](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16909)
* Meeting with Pierre this afternoon about joblib + dask
