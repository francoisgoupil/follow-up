## July 7th 2020

### Guillaume
* Mainly focused on the MOOC [#24](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/24)
* Move forward [#17768](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17768)

### Jérémie
* scalable / refactoring MiniBatchKMeans. Split big PR in smaller parts easier to review.

  [#17622](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17622)  <- big PR
  * [#17848](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17848)
  * [#17850](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17850)

* Early experiment with low-rank matrix factorization for missing value imputation.
  interesting papers:
  * http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/mazumder10a.pdf (nuclear norm regularization)
  * http://papers.nips.cc/paper/2655-maximum-margin-matrix-factorization.pdf  (maximum margin matrix factorization)
  * https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2596 (mix of both)
  * Gael suggests to check http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/v11/mairal10a.html and http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v48/mensch16.pdf 

### Gael
* Working on rewriting some contribution, triaging, and governance rules

### Chiara
* Trying to finalize [#17367](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17367)
* comparing original onlineNMF code from Patricio : why tol=0 and max_iter= 1 

### Lucy
* Working on implementing ensemble option in CalibratedClassifierCV [#17803](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17803)
* Looking into quantile regression, which requires benchmarking [#16343](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16343)
