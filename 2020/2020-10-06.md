## October 6th 2020

### Guillaume

* [PRs that need reviews](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+author%3Aglemaitre+label%3A%22Waiting+for+Reviewer%22)
* Reviewed work of Thomas linked to column name

    * https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18158

    * https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18444

    * blocker for Thomas: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18514#discussion_r498824450

* Mini-sprint in datacraft: possibility for recurrent sprints with people incubated in datacraft? To be discussed during the monthly Consortium meeting.

### Jérémie

* Review Chiara's PRs on NMF: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/18505 and https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16948
  Still check to do regarding fit.transform vs fit_transform
* pair programming with Thomas: implement mini batches in https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18492
* Small progress on the memory leak of MiniBatchKMeans: the leak is already in master, it appears only when X is not sparse; still more important in my PR (_Which one?_)

### Chiara

Working on:
  * NMF init https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18525
  * Workflow: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18500

### Olivier

* Released joblib 1.7 and loky 2.9 (we can now use physical CPU counts in scikit-learn were appropriate)
* Reviewing Thomas' PRs on feature names:
    https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18010 (feature names consistency)
    https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18444 (get output feature names)
* Reviewing Maria's PR on sample weights for standard scalers & co:
    https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18510 and linked PRs

### Alex

* sample_weight in StandardScaler avec Maria towards simplification of linear models: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18510
* ready to merge: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18537

### Loic
Working on The MOOC

### Tasks

* Guillaume: issue about displays https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18543 with Lucy (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17443)

* Jeremie: NMF with Chiara, continue Thomas PR

* Olivier + Loic + Pierre: work on joblib + dask about cluster computations.

* Chiara and Lucy: by the end of October propose a list of issues for a triaging sprint.
