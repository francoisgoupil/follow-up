## Notes July 28th

### PRs needing review
* Important: The countvectorizer issue needs attention for the release [#17939](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17939) Done, it seems
* Strict mode for check_estimator: [#17361](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17361) (Guillaume)
* Revamp of cross-decomposition module. Mostly docs and fixes: [#17095](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17095) Target or Impact encoder [#17323](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17323)
* plot_calibration_curve [#17443](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17443) (Olivier who already looked at it)

### Scrum

#### Gaël:
  * Been on vacations (very useful, I needed that)
  * Will try to review Target encoder
#### Guillaume:
  * MOOC (tree merged/review and merged linear model/finished ensemble) together with Thomas Schmitt
  * Implementation of prediction error plot [#18020](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18020)
    * Work on solving the issue with ROC-AUC together with Thomas Fan
  * Solving the issue with `get_score` [#17962](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17962)
    * Once done, solve issue ROC-AUC and compatibility with GridSearchCV (in short, fixing some internal inference regarding positive label) [#17704](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17704)
    * I can check [#17361](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17361) and check if it is helpful with third-party.
#### Olivier:
  * Pair debugging with Pierre on spurious cache invalidation on ipython/jupyter + memory: found a reproducer to include as test + drafted a potential fix
  * EuroPython sprint + reviews
  * Trying to debug ARM CI hanging (cannot reproduce the hanging locally) [#17996](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17996)
  * Next: prepare bugfix release before mid-august 
* Lucy:
  * Working on adding ensemble option to CalibratedClassifierCV. Nicolas reviewed refactoring and is happy with it so will add tests and amend docs: [#17856](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17856)
  * Working on SHAP vs permutation feature importance example
* Jérémie:
  * Still MiniBatchKMeans [#17622](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17622)
  * struggling with reassignment heuristic + memory leak + perf when small batch size
  * Part of above PR [#17973](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17973)

### General question and comments:
* Guillaume will help / lead the bugfix release, with Olivier
* Threadpoolctl is not been picked up. We should advertise it, and maybe drop it when numpy implements a good control mechanism of the underlying blas implementations
