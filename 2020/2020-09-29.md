## 29th September


### Olivier

- Reviewed and merge loky issues to prepare a release before Python 3.9 is released Monday, 2020-10-05: high priority.
- Would like to merge loky CPU core detection first: https://github.com/joblib/loky/pull/271
- Ongoing discussions on the performance of Hist GBDT with Dataiku, Fujitsu and Intel
- Next: reviewing feature names related issue in scikit-learn:
    https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18010
    https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16772
- Review ONNX documentation by Xavier Dupré

### Lucy
Any thoughts inf outputs in isotonic regression: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17758#issuecomment-693516146 
Inf would only occur for X values close to 0, could we replace inf outputs with `predict(0)` ?

### Chiara
- Triaging
- Presentation for PyLadies Paris Hacktoberfest
- Triaging ‘easy’ issues

### Gaël
- Came to an agreement with Nicolas Hug on proper defaults / simple recommendations for random state.
  Summary: to build and evaluate a pipeline, not an int, to compare pipelines, int in CV splitters.
- Question/task: we will need help Loic with the advanced scikit-learn course. Loic will organize a meeting.

### Jérémie
- Chiara’s PR for MiniBatchNMF, fit.transform vs fit_transform https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16948
- Online dict learning with missing values with Thomas: (Gael) we need to call this "online matrix factorization",
  because this is how the corresponding literature is calling it.
- Loky cpu count only physical cores

### Alex
Finish https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17743 with Maria now that I know that we are not stuck,
as Pipeline implements sample_weights routing (cf top comment in https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/18159)

### Loïc
- JupyterBook for https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc
- one-day training with Jérérémie and Alexandre Boucaud 

### Next points:

- Chiara + Jeremie : Online NMF
- Chiara (+ un peu Gaël): budget
- Loic + Gaël + Olivier : feedback love MOOC
- Alex + Maria : sample_weight / normalize
