## Guillaume
- Reviewing the PR https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16937 led to the following bug
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/17370 which should be fixed by
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17377 following to more issue to be cont'd with Olivier
- I would need a review on https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16619 (ICE) (need to be reviewed)
- I need a second approval for https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17356 (need to be reviewed)
- What is the expected value for a weighted percentile with all null weights?
  see e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile#The_weighted_percentile_method

Gaël:
- Funding with JP Smet accepted, we need to recruit one engineer
- Discussing with big computing (large-scale clusters) on optimizing scikit-learn for these settings
- Still working on big EU grant

Chiara
Cleaning old easy stalled issues
- https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16935
- https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17367

Olivier
- threadpoolctl maintenance: release 2.1.0 + CI diagnosis with conda-forge OpenMP
- (traditional) gradient boosting bugs loss function with sample weights under investigation:
  writing additional tests to understand what's going on
- still need to review dask joblib issues.
- https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16959

Lucy
- work on: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/8425  - adding plot_calibration_curve() 
- https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17373 (add doc + update example for test_permutation_score)
- https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17385

Jérémie
- openstack / gulliver, opened ticket on helpdesk
- threadpoolctl maintainance
- want to finish minibatch kmeans and kmeans++ work

Roman
- reviewing less strict estimator tests for contrib projects https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17361
  (and related issues/PRs)
- evaluate Cython 3.0 https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/17102
- related to earlier discussion on "API to specify test parameters"
  see https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/11324 we would likely find a number of bugs if we run the
  common tests on different solvers / losses. Use pytest-xdist to run tests in parallel on multi-core CPU.
