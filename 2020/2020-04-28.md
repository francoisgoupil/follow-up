- https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16801 (old sprint) waiting for approval
- Start thinking about all remote core dev sprint in June: should manage beginners and advanced events. To be tested:
    - https://discordapp.com/
    - https://remo.co/

### Olivier

    https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16648 : note that it's now on milestone 0.24

### Pierre
- joblib, better shared memory management, will be merged this week.
  https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/966
- Audit and benchmarks on Dask+joblib

### Jérémie
- Reviewing PRs 
  - multitask elasticnet: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17021
  - scipy blas in svm: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16530. Question: is it worth it to accept PR on svm code on which sklearn developers do not have total control?
- Opened PR to add asv benchmarks: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17026. Still WIP, in particular it needs documentation.
- To do: Intel benchmarks.

### Gaël

- Speedup MultiTaskLasso with Mathurin: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17021. Memoryview and Cython dependency should be defined in order to decide if this is in 0.23 or not. Asks for Jérémie review.

### Roman
