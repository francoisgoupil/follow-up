### Guillaume
* worked on MOOC regarding the evaluation of model:
    * 90% done with classification metrics
    * Discover some bugs: 
        * https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17594 (PR solving issue with plot_precision_recall_curve);
        * https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17569 (PR solving roc_auc_score bug); please have a look.
        * https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/15573 (issue to add pos_label to plot_roc_curve).
* Pass over 10-15 PRs from the previous sprint and merging whatever seems stalled + additional testing PR.
* Super interesting PR (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17432 ) where we would need Gael and Olivier.
  This could be used in the MOOC as well. (spoiler alert: statistical approaches to analyse the result of grid-search).

### Chiara
* https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16935 someone minds to comment?
* Sprint repository https://github.com/scikit-learn-inria-fondation/RemoteSprintJune2020/
* https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16948 : working on tests.

### Olivier
* Reviewed calibration related PRs:
  * https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17443
  * https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/11096
* joblib / dask pickle cache (still ongoing) 
  * https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/1055

### Jérémie
* run full benchmark suite on 0.22 and 0.23: https://scikit-learn-inria-fondation.github.io/sklearn-benchmark/#/
  no regressions apparently. Will check if it is possible to add tags to benchmark specific commits.
* Preparing pull request on scalable/refactor minibatch kmeans.
  Just submitted https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17622

### Gaël
* MOOC, in particular work on the chapter on the linear models, and simplification of the process.

### Lucy
* Cleaning up a few PRs, did some Sphinx-Gallery and RAMP stuff
* Update documnetation of `test_permutation_score`: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17373
  (has 1 approval, looking for 2nd review)
* Looking at calibration loss implementation (which will help finish the `plot_calibration_curve` PR)
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/11096

### Loïc
* working on the MOOC
