## November 17th 2020

### Chiara
- Release Highlights : https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18795
- release follow-up and triaging
- REMINDERs:
  - core-dev meeting on Monday November 30th at 8PM UTC: should we keep this time slot every month?
  - Administrative Consortium meeting Tuesday November 24th at 11AM

### Gael
- Review of the Consortium roadmap: please have a look.

### Jérémie
- Ongoing: benchmarks cuml / scikit-learn; next: benchmarks daal4py / scikit-learn.
  Goal: gather all benchmarks and publish in an issue to track what are our weak points , what can be done, etc...
- Add HistGradientBoosting to asv benchmark suite: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18851

### Guillaume

- Worked on the tags issues:
    * Implement of _safe_tags: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18797
    * Implement minimal required estimator withtout inheritance: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18811/files#diff-93f01e726832a31e922425cf82ec9bacb00398d4c93d0b351dab80d3eb7aac24
      I think that we need to solve it via a call to find a consensus.
- Took some time to make PR regarding DOC:
    * https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18821
    * https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18830
    * https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18835
    * https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18836

### Olivier

- Helped Juan Carlos improve the cibuildwheel architecture in particular debugging windows packaging issue in:
      https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18802
- We have problem with graviton2 arm:
    https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18782 (won't be fixed in time for 0.24) (Guillaume would be interested in knowing more there)
- CCA instability is fixed: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18746

### Loïc
- MOOC split notebooks and introdaction. Meeting with Learning Lab on Thursday

### Alex
- stalled on normalize option in linear models until there is the release

### Next steps / pairs:

- Gael + Olivier et tous : roadmap TC
- Guillaume organise a call with other dev-core about tags / check_estimator
- All: release 0.24 branch next week.
