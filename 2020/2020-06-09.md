# June 9th 2020

## Jérémie
- setting up weekly runs of scikit-learn benchmark suite on gulliver
  https://github.com/scikit-learn-inria-fondation/sklearn-benchmark: working on authentication problems
  https://scikit-learn-inria-fondation.github.io/sklearn-benchmark: just a test should be moved in the scikit-learn repo soon

## Chiara
- online NMF :
    - refactoring code : largely inspired by the MiniBatchDictionaryLearning structure, two new functions are defined
      (MiniBatchNMF and non_negative_factorization_online)
    - working on reproducing non-online code with the new code: how is the loop on slices working?
- documentation on CI for the sprint https://github.com/scikit-learn-inria-fondation/RemoteSprintJune2020/blob/master/6.ci.md

## Guillaume
- implementation of the weighted percentile (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17377).
  However, we get to a point where there are issues regarding the properties that we expect (equivalence between
  repeated samples and weighted scheme; interpolation)
- (a bit off topic) new release of imbalanced-learn compatible with scikit-learn 0.23

## Gael
- Still on grant proposal
- Started working on the scikit-learn MOOC. Current agenda: simplifying things

## Lucy
- added `plot_calibration_curve` and updated examples. Ready for review:
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17443
- working on making `CalibratedClassifierCV` work with pipeline (which includes transformer) where X is not array-like
  at the start: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/8710

## Olivier
- ongoing reviews on dask-joblib issues: https://github.com/joblib/joblib/labels/dask%20backend
- helping on some data umbrella PR reviews
- started to review ICE PR (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16619) but not familiar with PDP code
  so it's taking time

## Roman
- running common checks for estimators with non default parameters https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17441
- updating callbacks & logging discussion ( https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16925 , https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/17439 )
