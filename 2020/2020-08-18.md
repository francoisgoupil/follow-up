### Chiara
* help needed in triaging
  * [#15183](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/15183): Guillaume closed it but we need additional work there.
  * [Questions](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AQuestion)
  * pushing [old PRs already approved](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+review%3Aapproved+sort%3Acreated-asc+not-label%3Astalled+not-label%3Asuperseded+not-label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
* background work on NMF (but very high load on drago for benchmarks)
* pending PRs
  * [#18046](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18046)
  * [#18144](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18144)

### Guillaume
* Follow-up of [#10591](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/10591):
     * Additional tests + use new functionality + style: [#18169](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18169) (need second approval)
     * [WIP] Introduce the associated plotting function: [#18176](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18176) (pending requires above changes)
     * Propose to change function name for consistency: [#18181](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/18181)
* Additional common tests:
    * SearchCV tests: [#18158](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18158) (need second approval)
    * stacking+voting tests: [#18045](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18045) (required joel +1)
    * check if dtypes are preserved as expected: [#18054](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18054) (need second approval)
* Metric PRs:
    * Improve roc_auc_score docstring: [#18110](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18110) (need reviews)
    * fix scorer with string target: [#18114](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18114) (need reviews)
    * better error message in Brier score loss: [#18183](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18183)
* Plotting:
    * Add regression plot (useful for teaching - MOOC): [#18020](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18020)
      We need to have a larger discussion next week to know how to handle both plot_***(estimator, X, y) and plot_***(y_true, y_pred) case. (+1)

### Lucy
* Looked at MOOC, made some suggestions and fixed grammar. Really not sure on best workflow? Talked to Thomas and he will make PR on my PR branch and we can resolve suggestions.
* Nicolas makes good points in [#17443](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17443)
    * How does max-margin methods lead to under-confident classifier (sigmoid calibration curve).
      The Niculescu-Mizil & Caruana paper states it but does not expand. Other sources that say the same thing also quote this paper and does not expand.
    * How does Naive Bayes assuming 'attributes are conditionally independent given class', lead to over-confident classifier?
* Lost pull request: [#15907](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/15907)

### Gael
* Not much on the side of scikit-learn. A bit of follow up on the MOOC.

### Roman
* PolynomialCountSketch merged [#13003](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/13003)
* Need to finalize the review of the self learning PR [#11682](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/11682)
* Looking into sample_weight in pipeline [#18159](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/18159) and looking into
  [sample props](https://github.com/scikit-learn/enhancement_proposals/pull/16) implementations
* Possible 1 day scikit-learn sprint in Paris with Datacraft and WIMLDS 21, 22 or 29 september.
