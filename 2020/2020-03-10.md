## March 10th 2020

### Gael
* Conference call on intermediate data structure
  Notes: https://hackmd.io/fmeWMIqmTGSe6eR4F3Mb-g?sync=&type=

* Kick-started discussion on dataframe protocol https://discuss.ossdata.org/t/a-dataframe-protocol-for-the-pydata-ecosystem/267/8

### Guillaume

* Ongoing review for ICE PR: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16619

REQUEST FOR INPUT: return an array right now. Maybe a bunch is better?
A bunch could be a good solution

* Ongoing work on CutoffClassifier https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16525. Took a break from the PR to evaluate different strategy to find the optimal cutoff threshold: https://github.com/glemaitre/cutoff_experiments. This work is linked to interpretability and results from ongoing work in BalancedRandomForest: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/13227

Optimal cutoff threshold. Some References: http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume12/abrahamsen11a/abrahamsen11a.pdf

### Olivier

* Reviews related to support of type hints in cloudpickle: https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/318 (and linked PRs)
Working with Pierre Glaser (Foundation funding)

* Review / design of the memmap resource cleanup in joblib + loky (work done by Pierre): https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/966

Once this is done, next issues are: fix worker restart warnings in loky (gc problem?) and fix joblib + Dask bugs.

* Follow-up on GLM PR: improve Poisson regression example: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16648

### Jérémie

* Working on MiniBacthKMeans and the kmeans module in general (no link yet). Scalability, bug fixes, defaults params...
Benchmarks on convergence: will discuss with Olivier.
* Todo: test gpu offloading in cython (https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/3342)
This has the priority because of the coming-soon conf call with Intel.
* Todo: rework the benchmark suite to easily benchmark against cuml.

Possibility of asking Microsoft for cloud ressources for benchmarks?

### Alex
