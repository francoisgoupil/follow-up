### Olivier

- finalized and merged cloudpickle PR for fixing bugs with type annotations:
    https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/350
    https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/351
    https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/353
- remaining to do: review backport to Python 3.6:
    https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/pull/318
- joblib on standby till next week
    https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/966
- ecountered (known) bug with Yeo Johnson while working on the mooc, investigating with reproducer from:
    https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/14959#issuecomment-553429375
    (Guillaume's comment: This is a tricky one. There is a SciPy issue open because we cannot solve
    it in an easy manner as with Box-Cox cf. https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/10821).

### Guillaume

- (In progress) Reviewing PR linked to ICE. Got review from Olivier. Helping to structure the example.
- (Cont'd) Work related to CutoffClassifier. Additional experiments to do to be included in the discussion in the PR.
  Question: I am not sure how balanced-accuracy can be related in the PR space
   (I miss the relationship between precision and fpr) and the same of the f1 score in the ROC space
- Dedicate 1 day to the "Evaluation of machine learning models" notebook for the MOOC.

### Chiara
- budget
- pytest warnings https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/5685
- priorities:
     - metrics about Consortium contributions
     - user survey as proposed during the TC

Jérémie
- gpu offloading. I thought I built clang successfully. Turns out I didn't. Still trying.
- MinibatchKMeans. New figures but had to remake most of it (still running).

Gael
- Small wording changes on linear-coefficients interpretation example

Alex
- approved Nicolas PR https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16622: someone else can check and help finalise? 
- mean absolute percentage error: MAPE / MAPE: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/15007
