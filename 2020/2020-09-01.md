## September 1th 2020

### Chiara
* Working on NMF [#16948](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16948): the duplicated code has been reduced: still missing
    * loss investigations
    * tests
* Triaging [old PRs already approved](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+review%3Aapproved+sort%3Acreated-asc+not+not+not+label%3A%22Waiting+for+Reviewer%22):
  Feel free to review the older ones 
* PRs from the foundation sprints that need to be finalized:
  [#16293](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16293) SettingWithCopyWarning from pandas,
  [#17743](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17743) 'normalize' in LinearRegression (giving some issues in
  [#18159](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/18159)
* Pending PR from contributors:
    * [#18155](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18155), could someone check please? 
* Pending PR from me: [#18046](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18046) about model persistence documentation.

### Lucy

* Handling of inf output in isotonic regression: [#17758](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17758)
* Problems with strict monotonicity implementation: [#17790](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17790)
* Looking at GradientBoostingClassifier overshooting [#11452](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/11452)
* API of plot_* : see [core-dev meeting discussion](https://github.com/scikit-learn/administrative/blob/master/meeting_notes/2020-08-31.md#need-decision)

### Guillaume

* Mainly look at external contributions with reviews and merge
* Please check a [list of PR to review](https://github.com/scikit-learn/administrative/blob/master/meeting_notes/2020-08-31.md#need-attention-review)

### Olivier

* Catching up with ongoing issues / discussion.
* Discussion with Fujistu on performance of scikit-learn algorithms on their ARM-based A64FX CPU with 512 bit vector instructions with high bandwidth memory.
  Relevant for [arm related issues](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aarch%3Aarm).
* Parietal web sprint tomorrow could be an opportunity to review the consortium website together and see if we need to make some updates.
* Interesting paper mentioned by Alex for probabilistic predictions

    https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03178 XGBoostLSS / https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02121 CatBoostLSS (Location, Scale and Shape)

* Also, for Lucy's work on SHAP vs permutation importance and Guillaume on PDP / ICE examples:
     https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03151

### Jérémie

* benchmark suite merged: will move the runner scripts to scikit-learn-speed.
* [minibatch kmeans PR](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17622): need to check a few things regarding the memory leak.
