### Gael
* Comment for all: we need to start focusing on the release
* Worked a tiny bit on MOOC and need to do more
* Giving two talks (ODSC & Pydata global): Chiara will update the [event page](https://scikit-learn.fondation-inria.fr/scikit-learn-consortium-events/)
  on the consortium website

### Guillaume
* Mainly MOOC: tree, cross-validation, feature selection
* Worked on some of the [following](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+review%3Aapproved+sort%3Acreated-asc+not+not+not+label%3A%22Waiting+for+Reviewer%22)
  and need to go back for follow-up

### Olivier
* Fixed nested bugs in sklearn tests/scipy/conda-forge that caused a weird CI failure (boring but took a long time to understand what was going on):
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18667
* Reviewed and merged some of Maria & Alex' PRs on StandardScaler with sparse data, missing values and weights
* Reviewed Lucy's fix on IsotonicRegression that would predict nans
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18639 (Second review need! Quick PR easy to review)
* Currently reviewing and try to merge almost ready PRs labeled for the [0.24 milestone](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/milestone/38)

### Chiara
* Triaging ( https://github.com/scikit-learn-inria-fondation/follow-up/projects/3 ):
    * triaging sprint on Monday November 9th or Monday 16th?
* follow-up on [0.24 milestone](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/milestone/38):
    * eg https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18691

### Alex
* merge https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18682
* then https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17743

### Lo√Øc
* MOOC : nicer JupyterBook https://inria.github.io/scikit-learn-mooc/
* MOOC : reviewing existing material and Guillaume's PRs (not easy ...)

### Work for next week
* All: [0.24 milestone](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/milestone/38)
* Chiara reminder for the technical committee (Gael will create a Bluejeans link)
