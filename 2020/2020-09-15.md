### Jérémie
- work with Thomas on online dictionary learning with missing values.
- try to find a way to retrieve number of physical vs logical processors for loky (see [loky#223](https://github.com/joblib/loky/issues/223))
- make a pass on the mooc notebooks for a scikit-learn tutorial next week with Loïc

### Gaël
- Inria Academy course
- Reviewing the PR about random-state [#18363](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18363)

### Lucy
- Infinite probability with isotonic regression - [#17758](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17758):
  `make_unique` only used in isotonic regression but written in C
- Struggling with gradient boosting classifier over shoot issue [#11452](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/11452)

### Chiara
- MiniBatchNMF [#16948](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16948): Inheriting from NMF makes common tests failing on transform method.
  The transform method should be investigated with a bigger dataset and more iterations.
- Answered to all remaining 'question' issues in the issue tracker.
- Proposed a 'test-suite' label [#18396](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/18396): Adrin answered.
  The new label should be used on issues reporting missing or failing tests, or on PR specifically addressing tests.  

### Olivier
- Benchmarked scalability of HGBRT: logical processors hurts us more than other libraries:
  [#18382](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18382#issuecomment-691248375)
- Read a bit [stop permuting your features](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03151): we might want to extend the experiment with SHAP
  to see how SHAP behaves in this synthetic experiment.
- MOOC: make it run on binder and make the examples / exercises run fast.
