## July 21st 2020

### Guillaume
* Trying to fix couple of issues around the metrics:
    * Fixing roc_auc_score with compatibility in GridSearchCV: [#17962](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17962)
    * Got an issue with `get_scorer` not returning any copy: [#17942](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/17942), [#17962](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17962)
    * Utility for returning a dictionary of potential scorer by passing additional filtering and parameters: [#17930](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17930)
* Reviewing and discussing with Thomas S. regarding the notebooks on linear-models for Inria MOOC

### Olivier
* followup maintenance on joblib after the 0.16 release
* invesitgating joblib [#1021](https://github.com/joblib/joblib/issues/1021)
* played with black formatting 80 and 88 cols will write a summary on the:
    [#11336](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/11336)
* started to review trees notebook for the mooc
* call with Roman, Andreas and MLFlow on monitorying the fit method of scikit-learn estimators (related to [#16925](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16925))

### Jérémie
* reviewing [#17937](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17937) (making kmeans++ public)
* Continued splitting kmeans refactoring in smaller parts
* new pr: make tol=0 in kmeans work -> check labels don't change between 2 iterations ([#17959](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17959))
* worked a bit on low rank matrix factorization for missing value imputation

### Lucy
* Refactor CalibratedClassifierCV and add `ensemble` option. Nicholas suggested refactor class (only refactor in [#17803](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17803)) to help implementation (refactor and implementation in [#17856](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17856)).
would be good for someone to see if the refactor makes sense.
* Working on doc comparing SHAP with permutation feature importance. From 'priority list': "Possibly add an example in scikit-learn to compare SHAP values to scikit-learn permutation importances and highlight pro-and-cons". Comments welcome.
* Some confusion on interpretation of sigmoid calibration: [#17725](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17725) with Nicolas. Help welcome.

### Roman
* looking for feedback on the callbacks and in particular on the interaction with joblib ([#16925](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16925))
* wondering about portability of model pickles across architectures.
