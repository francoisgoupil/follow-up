- 2 days break was nice :)
- Continued reviewing/benchmarking pairwise distances + agg #20254
- Merged [#18010](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18010): follow-up work needed to fix the estimators in the modules of the [ignore list](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18010/files#diff-fb7eceec9814052022bd3e482d161cf5d2a8f1b4a4022663e6243329890cb75fR327-R335).
- Continued review/discussions of Mathis work on the benchmark.
