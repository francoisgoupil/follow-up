### Julien

 - Was off on Friday and Monday (moved in Paris Region)
 - [#20254](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20254) Private Cython submodule for aggregations over pairwise distances:
     - Introduced `FastSquaredEuclideanRadiusNeighborhood`
     - [Performed benchmarks](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20254#issuecomment-888482901): (1.2× to 20× speed-up)
     - Add tests for the private submodule (Next: I need to factorise them)
     - Currently adapting failing tests for 32 bits
     - Next: see if it's worth factoring some parts for `FastSquaredEuclidean`
     - Next: find a good API, `metric="fast_squared_euclidean"`? (Check consistency with Scipy names)
 - Reviewed PRs with Guillaume
 - Reviewed Mathis' work (see above)
 - Cython+:
     - read Cython code base + generated a bird eye overview of the code
     - read(ing) [a thesis about _reference capabilities_](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1164769/FULLTEXT01.pdf) for the new types system of Cython+

### Jérémie
_Off this month_


### Guillaume ([My GitHub Board](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/projects/17))

### Loïc

- Do a single summarised warning for fit failures during cross-validation https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20619. Ready for another round of review.
- some MOOC, in particular update [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and added [workflow-notes.md](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/blob/master/workflow-notes.md)
- holidays next week, back on September 6

### Arturo

Was partially off on holidays last week

- Worked with Loïc and Olivier to address Issue [#418](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/418), resulting in PR [#422](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/422)

- Created 2 additional PRs ([#423](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/423) and [#424](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/424)), 2 Issues ([#426](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/426) and [#427](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/427)) and had 2 old PRs merged ([#400](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/400) and [#401](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/401))

- Continued following the MOOC and addressing problems on the fly (Module 4)

### Roman
