## December 14th, 2021

### Guillaume

- Work around `fetch_openml` [21938](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21938)
    - reuse C-parser from pandas => x4-x10 speed-up for reading and /2 memory efficiency
    - refactor and simplify the code
    - refactor, simplify, and remove redundant code in tests
- Discussion with Alex and Gael on missing data
- Follow-up with Adrin on sample-props
- Triage meeting last Friday
- Next: catch-up with emails (GitHub reviews)
- Next: some follow-up after for `check_scalar`
- Next: finalize TC notes
- Next: follow-up of core-dev meeting
- Release 1.0.2 [blocker](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/21949)

### Julien

 - Was off last week
 - Writing blog posts for Cython+ with Xavier:
     - [KDTree experiments](https://jjerphan.xyz/kdtree.html)
     - [Current proposed async runtime backend](https://jjerphan.xyz/cython-async-backend.html)
 - Next: to help with the [`PairwiseDistancesArgKmin` PR](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21462):
     - break the PR in smaller PRs as proposed 
     - write a blog post for the general `PairwiseDistancesReduction` design and direction
 - Misc: I think this PR needs attention:
     - [[MRG] Monotonic Contraints for Tree-based models #13649](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/13649)

### Gael

- Added Juan Martin to triage (our doc-building part is broken?)
- Talking with Bercy about next steps

### Alex

- Talk EDF... let's see how it goes

### Jérémie
- Finished prototyping a set of the important to have callbacks: ProgressBar, Verbose, EarlyStopping, Snapshot, ConvergenceMonitor
- docstring friday (for the callbacks) and a bit monday too :)
- currently setting up LogisticRegression (and Pipeline or GridSearch right after) to accept callbacks to have a poc to open a PR.

### Olivier

- Working on MOOC reviews / merges / fixes
    - `permutation_test_score` and chance level [#499](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/499)
    - matching quizz question fix: [MR !32](https://gitlab.inria.fr/learninglab/mooc-scikit-learn/mooc-scikit-learn-coordination/-/merge_requests/32)
- My opinion to help move the ArgKMin PR forward: [#21462#issuecomment-992581822](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21462#issuecomment-992581822)
- Next: would like to think about feature names propagation to tackle the handling of categorical features in pipelines with HGBRT [#18894](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/18894) and bagging meta-estimators [#21811](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21811)
- Next: some CSS problem to fix with the embedded youtube iframes
- Next: help review PRs for the Fujitsu sprint (end of the week)

### Arturo

Off

### Alex P

- Started working on documenting missing-values practices (Issue [#21967](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/21967)). Need approval, and decisions on how to split it into smaller tasks/PRs. 
- Started working on new feature (arbitrary regressor for CalibratedClassifierCV, issue [#21280](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/21280)). Will soon create WIP PR, and have some question.
