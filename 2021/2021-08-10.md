### Jérémie

_Off this month_

### Guillaume ([My GitHub Board](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/projects/17))

- Additional work on plotting API: [#18020](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18020) [#16061](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16061)
- Work regarding `available_if`:
    - replace `if_delegate_has_method` by `avalaible_if`: [meta-issue with link to PRs](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/20506)
    - replace `property` for response methods by `available_if`: [#20667](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20667)
- Start looking at estimators validating in elsewhere than `fit`: [#20683](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20683)
- Explicit copy in `_safe_indexing` to avoid Pandas warning [#20773](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20673)
- introduce `check_scalar` for parameter validation [#20724](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/20724) -> open an RFC just to know if it is worth it. It might be a good long issue for sprint.
