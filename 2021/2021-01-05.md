### Jérémie
- MiniBatchDictionaryLearning stopping criterion (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18975).
  Tested ewa on objective function and norm of dict difference (prefered).
  plots vs batch_size (4: https://imgur.com/cQK7fiw, 32: https://imgur.com/qmvpGiT, 128: https://imgur.com/lLCy4d6, 512: https://imgur.com/2brjWnt )
  small batch size seems to converge faster
- assignments from the candidates. Coding parts are not that informative. Questions are a lot more informative.
