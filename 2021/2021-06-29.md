# Consortium follow-up

## June 29, 2021


### Gael
- Pushing forward the hire on the comunication/comunity job
- Organisation of scikit-learn@Inria
- Arturo is arriving on Thursday to work on the MOOC

### Julien

 - Have been adapting implementation for pairwise reduction
     - :wip: Started an [OOP version of it](https://github.com/jjerphan/scikit-learn/pull/2), allowing to integrate more reduction (querying Neighbors in radius, cumulative sum, etc.); discussed it on Friday (see [notes](https://notes.inria.fr/h6O9IicMRBiltObBTzeTaQ#enh-optimise-aggregations-over-pairwise-distances))
 - Asked Xavier for a sync for Cython+ delivrables, Sven (from Nexedi) planned follow-up discussions with every member of the Cython+ consortium accordingly (I am looking forward to it)
 - Sporadically been reviewing PRs
 - Openned [a conversation in the Cython user group for unexpected slowdowns with memory view](https://groups.google.com/g/cython-users/c/rU0_mt3Vgn0/m/1DytI0fKAAAJ)

### Mathis
- Benchmark framework:
    - Split main reporting notebook into several parts (perfect match HP and different HP)
    - Several important bug fixes on HPO curves visualization
    - Work on ONNX runtime benchmarks for predictions
    - Started a refactoring branch to clean up the code

### Guillaume

- Send email for TC notes (Jeremie published them)
- Forum MOOC
- Make an overview of `feature_names`
- Join the LATAM sprint on Saturday night
- PRs to be reviewed/merged:
    - kPCA examples: [#19945](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19945) [#20248](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20248)
    - GPR examples: [#20360](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20360) [#20361](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20361) [#20359](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20359) [#20358](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20358) [#20357](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20357)

### Olivier

- Reviews for the data-umbrella sprint
- Many CI-related fixes
- next: finalize cyclic time feature PR [#20281](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20281)
- next: calibration display PR [#17443](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17443)
- next: feature names consistency checks
- next: cython losses review [#19088](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19088)

### Jérémie
- debug asv Benchmarks -> black refreshed everything. Manual run of 0.24
- MiniBatchNMF. Hard to make fit and partial_fit do exactly the same (init, fresh restarts). Tests finally all green but need to add more tests.
- discussion benchmarks & pairwise distances with Mathis and Julien and Olivier (friday).

### Loïc
- some CI fixes (nightly build highlighting pytest bug)
- MOOC forum
- Arturo: ideas for good things to start on?
    - Gaël: Do the MOOC (but something else in parallel)
    - Loïc: looking at the forum is a good way to get a feeling for the participants
    - Olivier: identify a section with concepts that caused many questions in the forum and would benefit from diagrams/slides to rephrase the problematic concept
- FYI: no participants for Inria academy session (should have been yesterday and today)
- FYI: Jean Zay User Committee this week

## Alex

- Reviewed Ridge regression and positive constraints on the
  weights now using L-BFGS-B.
- Finished PRs on Normalize:
  - [#17785](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17785) DONE

### TODO:

- Alex brings back laptop
- Gael moves forward job profiles and hiring
- Julien: pursue integration/design for aggregation of pairwise distances
- Column name consistency [#18010](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18010) (Guillaume, Olivier)
- Calibration plot [#17443](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17443) (Guillaume, Olivier)
- decorator `if_available` (Guillaume)
- Guillaume: off from Thursday afternoon
- Jérémie: MiniBatchNMF
