# June 8th 2021

## Gael

- Trying to organize a "service scikit-learn": definition of roles
- Infrastructure for MOOC
- Hiring for MOOC
- Job profile

## Chiara

- organigramme
- PRs debugging:
  - Dependencies installation with `pip` and `--no-build-isolation` option [#20212](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/20212)
  - Remove `__file__` from python files to know path of file module [#20150](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20150)

## Julien

- Cython+:
  - looking for some API design, Pattern and Anti-Pattern inspiration for Xavier
  - KDTree
    - compared tree construction against sklearn (faster in some tests cases)
    - implementing the `query` using Actors + comparing against sklearn's
- pdist_aggregation
  - sync'ed with Mathis for supporting other distances
  - 32 bits support
- Came at INRIA and got my machine (hence I will be able to run benchmark on drago (yeay!))

## Jérémie

- `n_features_in_` (meta-estimators, docstring params, common_tests):
  - [MRG] Check that property are documented when they are used as a fitted attributes [#20190](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20190)
  - [MRG] Check `n_features_in_` in module `sklearn.pipeline` [#20192](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20192)
  - [MRG] Check `n_features_in_` in module `sklearn.multiclass` [#20193](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20193)
  - [MRG] Check `n_features_in_` in module `sklearn.feature_extraction` [#20180](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20180)
- Currently: allow no `X` validation in `_validate_data`.
  [#20227](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20227)
- Rounding errors in kmeans [#20200](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20200)
- Tips: change your ldap password before it expires.

## Guillaume

- MOOC forum/fixes with Loic
- `n_features_in_` with Jeremie, Olivier, and Loic
- Adding `HalvingSearchCV` into common tests [#20203](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20203)

## Olivier

- First pass of review on monotonicity constraints for Decision Trees
  [#13649](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/13649)
- scikit-learn tutorial @ ODSC 2021 tomorrow
- Follow-up on PRs related to `n_features_in_` for meta-estimators

## Mathis

- Improvements on randomized HPO curves (pareto front and quartile curves). See [here](https://mbatoul.github.io/sklearn_benchmarks/#Smoothed-HPO-Curves).
- Add more grad boosting libs: `catboost` is done, `tensorflow` WIP (needed Linux env)
- Sync with Julien regarding adding new optimized distances
- Spent some time setting up my INRIA machine

## Loïc

- MOOC forum with Guillaume
- small scikit-learn things
  - KMeans unstable in main (same as Jérémie above) [#20199](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/20199)
  - Help Lucy debug matplotlib backend issue in her PR [#17443](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17443)

## Questions

- Should we set matplotlib agg backend in pytest_configure? Yes it seems, upcoming PR
- Julien and Norbert in the triage team? Who will take care of this?

## Work for next week

- Julien:
  - K++ init in Cython
  - Can review PRs
  - KDTree for Cython+
  - Might implement other algorithms for Cython+
- Gael:
  - Set up scikit-learn service
  - Sort out infrastructure for MOOC
  - Hire for MOOC
- Guillaume
  - Announcement in mailing team regarding Julien
- Olivier, Gael, Guillaume
  - Finalize roadmap
- Olivier, Julien & Pierre Glaser
  - cloudpickle / loky / joblib
- Guillaume, Jerémie, Loïc
  - Finalize `n_features_in_` for review:
    - TST classification/regression for `SearchCV` [#20202](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20202)
    - TST `HalvingSearchCV` [#20203](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20203)
    - Check `n_features_in_` in module `sklearn.model_selection` [#20204](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20204)
