### Alex

### Jérémie

- Review Julien's PR https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20254
  Main focus on trying to profile cython code properly
- OpenMP / OpenBLAS interaction. Reproducible example in C. There's definitely something going on (not sure it's unexpected still). Blocked again :(

### Julien

- Got a comprehensive overview of Cython's codebase and Cython+ diff
- [#20254](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20254)
    - Started treating Olivier's and Jeremy's reviews suggestions
    - Inspecting potential performance gains to get to Intel's performance on some case
        - reworking parallelisation strategy on Y (not optimal to me)
        - inspecting hotspots with tools like `perf(1)`
- At Nexedi this week:
- Syncing with Xavier, JPS on Cython+
- Technical discussions and progress tracking with Xavier
- Meeting with a new dev' from Abilian and people from IMT
- Finishing reviews' suggestions

### Guillaume

- Follow-up release:
    - Checking PRs of Adrin
    - PR for inconsistency in Display API
- Working on the ThresholdClassifier:
    - [#21041](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21041): small bugs related to shape of `y_pred` in current `_get_response`
    - [#21032](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21032): Adding `pos_label` to `calibration_curve` and later the display
    - Refactoring of a functionality to get predictions
    - Refactoring of the displays that only accept binary classifier

### Loïc

- [#21026](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21026) to have an error when all the fits fail during cross-validation or grid-search. One failing test to investigate (nested CV with groups where all the fits fail was a warning and is now an error) ...
- Trying to get access to the MOOC forum (can not login since the move to read-only), if you can connect to the forum, please look at this [Mattermost message](https://mattermost.inria.fr/parietal/pl/pwu1xqob6pnwpnydksw1ifcxne)
- FYI Inria Academy: base course end October, Inria advanced course mid-December, advanced course end January

### Arturo

-  Worked on extension to [Loïc's notes](https://notes.inria.fr/rgSzYtubR6uSOQIfY9Fpvw#) to report questions to look at but that dont relate to score.
- Presented slides to discuss my experience doing the MOOC.
- Currently creating GitHub issues from presentation discussion, resulting in [#453](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/453), [#456](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/456), [#457](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/457) and [#458](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/458).
- Started addressing previous issues, resulting in PRs [#454](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/454) and [#455](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/455).

     - Close performance gap for #20254
         - Profiling OpenMP threads  by capturing OpenMP events using `perf` directly in a setup similar to [this one](https://www.maartenbreddels.com/perf/jupyter/python/tracing/gil/2021/01/14/Tracing-the-Python-GIL.html)?
