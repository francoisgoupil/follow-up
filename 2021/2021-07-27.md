### Loïc

- some MOOC infrastructure work to make it easier on ourselves:
  - generate exercises from solutions https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/408 => still need to go over the exercises outside of Module 1 and modify them https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/418
  - _changed.html in PR CircleCI artifacts a la scikit-learn https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/411
- other MOOC things:
  - brain dump on MOOC workflow quirks going to CONTRIBUTING.md soon https://notes.inria.fr/pU4f-hCaQ6mdCBPwXuFYvg#
  - reviewed Arturo PRs, still some to do
- some progress on [#20475](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/20475), warning for fit failures in the main process for cross-validation. Questions:
  - remove _fit_and_score (i.e. per split) warning => impact on BaseSearchCV derived classes outside of scikit-learn
  - test_callable_multimetric_clf_all_fails quirk, multi-metric raises an error when all the fits failed, is there a good reason for this?
- 4 weeks holidays: August 9 - September 5
