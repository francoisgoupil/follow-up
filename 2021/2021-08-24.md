- Follow-up PRs for feature names consistency checks in meta-estimators: linked at the bottom of [#1810](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18010)
- Profiled [#20254](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20254) to understand the discrepancy with scikit-learn-intelex and found bugs in profilers (reported upstream)
- Make viztracer work with joblib/loky: [#299](https://github.com/joblib/loky/pull/299)
- Reading [Uncertainty in Gradient Boosting via Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10562) pointed to me by Leo from Dataiku: need stochastic gradient boosting + `predict_dist` for regression?
- Next: continue consistency checks
- Next: resume work on MOOC
- Next: resume work on proof of concept numba-dppy

### Mathis

  - Work on fixing reporting bugs and improve overall reporting
  - Ensure deterministic results
    - Issue with joblib Memory cache not hit

### Arturo

- Continued working on the MOOC (finished Module 6).
- Created issues [#439](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/439), [#441](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/441), [#442](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/442) and [#443](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/443), as well as PR [#440](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/440)
- Made notes (for myself) classifying notebooks depending on the data-set split and whether they use any scoring or not (will result in new issues coming soon)
- Continued cross-linking forum posts with issues in GitHub and [Loïc's notes](https://notes.inria.fr/rgSzYtubR6uSOQIfY9Fpvw#) to find problematic questions and how to improve them (Issue [#432](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/432))

### TODO Next

- Work on Loïc's notes (Olivier)
- Resume PoC with numba-dppy (Olivier)
- Create github issues out of forum posts and problematic quizzes (Arturo, Olivier?)
