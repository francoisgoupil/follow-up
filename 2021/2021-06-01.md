## June 1st 2021

### Chiara
- Minimalist fixes to MiniBatchNMF: I'm passing on it, I will not have time to finish before leaving.
- Checking https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17443
- Fujitsu sprint

### Gael

- Hiring for MOOC
- Politics around the cloud resources for MOOC

### Mathis
- Made some improvements on Manhattan distance optimization (discussed with Olivier, Jérémie and Julien)
- Read about `BLAS` to maybe use some routines for Manhattan
- Benchmark sequential and parallel Manhattan distances
- Work on adding `Catboost` and `TensorFlow`'s decision forests to grad boosting benchmarks
- Improved randomized search reporting by fixing HPO curves' smoothness (thanks Olivier!)
- Start investigating some UI issues with `plotly` regarding the main benchmark reports

### Olivier
- MOOC feedback reviews
- Fujitsu sprint reviews
- Some live pair debugging of the permutation smoothing of the benchmark tool
- Preparing the TC meeting presentation

### Guillaume
- Gave a couple of lectures
- Follow-up MOOC forum
- Follow-up Fujitsu PRs
- Draft a couple of entries for Olivier presentation for TC

### Julien
 - `pdist_aggregation`: Fast Euclidean in progress
     - 32 bits supports (wip), this is quite hard to support with Fast Euclidean
     - `return_distance`: done
     - exploring the support of other distances
     - exploring mitigation for the `gemm`-trick
 - Caught up with Xavier for Cython+, waiting for mock-up from him
 - A few discussions for the Common loss private module: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19088

### Jérémie
- "finished" review for MiniBatchNMF
- discussions with Mathis, Julien and Olivier about benchmarks and pairwise distances.
- reviewed few PRs from the sprint
- n_features_in_ in compose and feature_extraction.
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20175
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20180

### Loïc
- MOOC: forum and organisation => "Coordination" category in the Discourse forum for the MOOC team https://mooc-forums.inria.fr/moocsl/c/coordination/270
- MOOC recruitment interview
- joblib: fix CI (yeah something technical \o/, weird hang in CircleCI doc generation => used ReadTheDocs instead)
- looking for more technical things to do outside of the MOOC! Let me know if you have suggestions!
- misc: was officially elected in the Jean-Zay Users Committee.

### Alex
- I was asked to give a talk on scikit-learn for BNP late August
- I will talk to Dassault June 17 (dealt above by Inria)

### TODO

- Scikit-learn @ Inria organisation (Chiara & Gael)
- Community manager position job offer (Gael & everybody)
- Technical committee of the consortium (Chiara, Gael, Olivier, Guillaume, Jeremie, Alex)
- Mathis:
    - Update HPO curves:
        - Report quartile rather than mean permutated curves
        - Add front pareto
    - Distance metrics: discuss with Julien how to update the dist metrics module
- `n_features_in_` (Guillaume, Jeremie, Loïc)
- Julien:
    - pdist_aggregation + distance metrics
    - Drafted PRs
