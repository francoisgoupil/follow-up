### Alex G

Rien.

### Jérémie
- off last wed/thu/fri
- reviewed Julien's PR + few small PRs
- refreshing my MiniBatchDictionaryLearning PR

### Gael
- Moved forward with the hiring process for community job
- Strategy and politics for landing a lot of money (and many hires) in scikit-learn
- Started the comms teams, but got stuck when I had to write some Python to create the web page :D

### Julien

 - Hopefully-maybe-the-last Review Rounds on [#20254](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20254)
 - PR reviews, especially [#13649](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/13649) "[MRG] Monotonic trees (continued)" which has been waiting 
 - Working with Arturo on [#21341](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21341)
 - Bench' of CuML vs sklearn#20254 vs sklearnex + call with Intel (w. Olivier)
 - Looking [a recent experimental fork of CPython with nogil](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-dev@python.org/thread/ABR2L6BENNA6UPSPKV474HCS4LWT26GY/) especially re: Cython+
 - Off on Friday (waiting for approval)

### Guillaume

- was off monday, tuesday, wednesday
- investigated crash of the CIs
- help for interview

### Loïc

- Pickle portability across architecture 32/64bits and little/big-endian [#21237](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/21237). Next: open a PR to address [#21359](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/21359) with test.
- Started [#21330](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21330) (part of [#21308](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/21308) to add feature names out in `random_projection` module). Probably need to wait for some other Thomas PRs to be reviewed.
- Next: Willow/Sierra retreat tomorrow to Friday
- Next: Inria Academy session next week Thursday and Friday


### Arturo

- Continued working on video post-production (PRs [#471](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/471) and [#472](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/472)) and slides for video on cross-validation (Issue [#439](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/439)).
- Started working with Julien on PR [#21341](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21341) (Add `check_scalar` to Ridge regularizing parameter).
- Attendance at a course for improving my public speaking.

### Olivier

- More hiring interviews
- CI fixes / developer doc fixes to prepare the data umbrella sprint
- Various reviews on PRs blocking 1.0.1 / feature names
- Manual benchmarks to compare Julien's kNN and scikit-learn-intelex to cuML on a margaret node with 64 physical cores and 1 V100 GPU:
    - GPU on float32 data is faster:
      - by a factor of 2-3x vs scikit-learn-intelex on float32 or float64 data
      - by a factor 4-8x compare to Julien's PR on float64 data
  - 2x32 cores CPU is more expensive and at least 2x energy intensive than 1 V100 GPU.
  - Conclusion: not as fast as 100x benchmarks one can observe in blog posts but probably still worth investing more in GPU infra for the future of scikit-learn.
  - Tried to do the same on Intel's GPU ("Xe max" / Gen 11) on devcloud but:
      - some problems with double precision error message (on float32 data...)
      - devcloud was not always responsive when trying to use the GPU (no problem with the CPU)
      - no access to Gen12 GPU (Ponte Vecchio) yet that should be closer to NVidia GPU in terms of FLOPS. But Intel Gen12 GPUs should be commercialized in early 2022 according to non-intel affiliated hardware blogs/websites.
- Next: notify rejected candidates
- Next: write statement of work for Intel candidates
- Next: feature names and 1.0.1 blockers
- Next: re-record MOOC videos


### Alex P

Took [#21280](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/21280) 
Ran into some segfault issue while running tests (test_common.py::test_estimators[NuSVC()-check_classifiers_train(readonly_memmap=True)]) [#21361](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/21361)

### Discussion

- Discussion with Intel colaboration for pluggable
