### Gael

* "strategy" for scikit-learn@Inria (notion of "platform")
* Thursday: Talking to DSI about OVH for MOOC

### Olivier

- MOOC forum
- Released threadpoolctl 2.2.0 to report CPU architecture detected by OpenBLAS / BLIS ([#85](https://github.com/joblib/threadpoolctl/pull/85)) to debug ARM64 failing builds. Still need to report the problem upstream to OpenBLAS.
- Reviews:
    - Feature names consistency [#18010](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18010)
    - Avoid OpenMP oversubscription in HistGBRT [#20477](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20477)
    - ...
- Started to evaluate numba for writing GPU kernels for Intel with dppy and Nvidia with cuda (ongoing)
- Design discussions with team members

### Mathis
- Benchmark tool (`sklearn_benchmarks`):
    - Done:
        - Add `ONNX` to prediction benchmarks (perfect match and HPO)
        - Fix several bugs on HPO plots
        - Small UI improvements
        - Add time budget for predictions (3sec for now)
    - Next:
        - Adapt code to run benchmarks on Margaret
        - Refactor code
- PR [MAINT Use Tempita for WeightVector #20481](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20481):
    - This PR continues [previous work from massich](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/13358)
    - Done:
        - Resolved pending conflicts
        - Add test to check that files generated from Tempita templates are git ignored
    - WIP:
        - Add unit tests for the `WeightVector` interface (types invariance, 32-bit support)
- PR [ENH Optimise aggregations over pairwise distances #20254](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20254) (work supervised by Julien):
    - WIP:
        - Implement `sparse - sparse` and `dense - sparse` distance matrices computations for euclidean and Manhattan distances as well as cosine dissimilarity
    - Next:
        - Integrate this work to scikit-learn

### Julien
 - PR [ENH Optimise aggregations over pairwise distances #20254](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20254)
     - Done with a new `RadiusNeighborhood` reductions (see [this PR](https://github.com/jjerphan/scikit-learn/pull/3) if you like C++ plumbing)
     - Currently benchmarking original "flat" implementations with those new ones base on this class hierarchy
     - Next: Benchmark `RadiusNeighborhood`
     - Next: Support for `sparse - sparse` and `dense - sparse` strategy
        - Currently in some design (might introduce some `Mixin` for extensions types to deleguate the distance computations)
        - Synced with Mathis for implementations
    - Next: add a _bunch_ of  tests for this private submodule
 - Intel numba-dppy: did some exploratory work for discussions, see [notes](https://notes.inria.fr/RcuArVnFTG-9gz6zRVU6TA#)
 - Some discussions with Mathis regarding superseding a stalled PR, see [here](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20481)
 - Next: Cython+ with Xavier (rerunning benchmark, moving on Nexedi's gitlab instance, etc.)

### Jérémie
- MiniBatchNMF and NMF regularization issues. -> scale the regularization terms.
  issue for the discussion https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/20484
  pr https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20512
- threadpoolctl, review & pr for 2.2
- PR reviews

### Guillaume ([My GitHub Board](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/projects/17))

- Mainly worked on partial dependence (PD) and individual conditional expectation (ICE):
    - Add an option `centered` to ICE or ICE + PD to anchor to zero x-axis: completed [#18310](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18310) -> need reviews
    - Add granularity and allow passing a list of ICE/PD request for individual features: [#19438](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19438) nice to have for categorical features support -> Need reviews
    - Add an option to color PD line over ICE lines: completed [#19428](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19428) -> need reviews
    - Make a [PR](https://github.com/madhuracj/scikit-learn/pull/2) to [18298](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18298) to rework/simplify example while adding support to categorical features in PD -> awaiting on the contributor side for merging to be make additional reviews
- A couple of additional PRs reviews and merging

- Backlog PR to be reviewed/merged:
    - kPCA examples: [#19945](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19945)
    - GPR examples: [#20360](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20360) [#20361](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20361) [#20359](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20359) [#20358](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20358) [#20357](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20357)
