## September 28th, 2021

### Gael

- Hiring community manager
- Presentation to DGDI

### Alex

### Jérémie

- threadpoolctl maintenance
- threadpoolctl: new object oriented API
  https://github.com/joblib/threadpoolctl/pull/95
  goal: use a global controller for scikit-learn to avoid
  the overhead of looping through all shared libs each time
- threadpoolctl: possibility to use it as a decorator
  https://github.com/joblib/threadpoolctl/pull/102
- Next: Check that it solves our perf issue in sklearn, then
  release 3.0.0

### Julien

 - In reviews for [#20254](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20254)
     - reworking `PairwiseDistancesReduction.compute`
     - a few small PRs to extract patches:
         - [#21177](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21177) Move `DistanceMetric` under `metrics`
         - [#21174](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21174) CI Adapt Circle CI script for ARM
         - [#21178](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21178) TST Handle Connection error in `test_load_boston_alternative` (to fix random CI failures)
 - Getting into the implementation of `HistGradientBoosting*` for:
     - [#21020](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21020) FEA add interaction constraints to HGBT
     - [#21130](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21130) FIX out of bound error in split_indices
 - Off on next Monday

### Guillaume

- Issues with `sample_weight` in `CalibratedClassifierCV`:
    - Fix for the equivalence between 0/2 sample weights and removing/repeated samples [#21179](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21179)
    - Check meaning of `sample_weight` on estimator/calibrator
- refactoring `_get_response`
    - Follow-up with `pos_label` in calibration: [#21032](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21032) [#21038](ttps://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21038)

### Loïc

- Raise an error if all the fits fail during cross-validation or grid-search: [#21026](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21026). Type of the error ? Is `NotFittedError` fine ?
- test_k_means_fit_predict failing intermittently with csr_matrix and float32: [#21660](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/21160). Probably one for Jérémie ;-)

### Arturo

- Created video to explain HTML interactive plot of pipeline in issue [#465](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/465).
- Created PRs [#459](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/459), [#460](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/460), [#461](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/461), [#462](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/462), [#463](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/463) and [#464](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/464) to address already existing issues.


### Olivier

- Helped a bit Adrin with the 1.0 release
- Design discussion / reviews for threadpoolctl's refactoring with Jeremie:
  - Idea: maybe we should use the scipy SPEC mechanism to discuss OpenBLAS / OpenMP packaging at some point in the future in particular to deal with problems such as [#20642](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/20642)
- Analysis of sample weight issues for calibrated classifiers with Guillaume
- Reviewed PRs mentionned by Christian at the team meeting
- Started to review interaction constraints PR [21020](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21020) (ongoing)
- Mathis should be able to start his contract soon (last step was to get a professional insurance)
- Next: draft collaboration doc with Intel (last week's [technical meeting notes](https://notes.inria.fr/-9Qm5fvUR2ajbHpxsMsg-g#))
- Next: feedback to Arturo on MOOC videos and other improvements
- Next: review Julien's PR
- Next: hiring Community Manager

### Discussion

### TODO / Next

- Continue working with MOOC video(s) (Arturo, Guillaume-review)
- Hiring community manager (Gael)
- Roadmap building (Gael):
    - Ask everyone in the internal team to give a list of 5 points that important for the 2-year horizon of scikit-learn
    - Cluster this
- Liaison officer: Ask our community if someone wants to be a liaison officer (Gael)
- Announce 79 vs 88 char line length (Gael)
- PR to set up communication team (Gael)
- `CalibratedClassifierCV` and `sample_weight`
