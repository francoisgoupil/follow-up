(matrix factorization with missing values https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18492)
(tutorial on machine learning with missing values http://dirtydata.science/python/gen_notes/01_missing_values.html)

### Julien

 - Reviewed about 30 PRs (some might be mergeable)
 - Some "ping-pong" reviews for [#20254](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20254) and its sub-PRs (now merged)
 - Getting into joblib again for:
     - [joblib#588](https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/588)
     - Stress testing interfaces with scikit-learn and `dask/distributed`
 - Some discussions with Xavier.T for Cython+


### Guillaume

- Off today

### Loïc

- debugged [#21237](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/21237). Pickling a model on an architecture (little endian) and unpickling in a different architecture (big endian) gives an error. Seems like joblib 1.1.0 avoids the issue ... lesteve/s390x-scikit-learn docker image if you need it
- joblib release with Gaël

### Arturo

- Finished working on pipeline video ([#465](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/465)) and parallel plot video ([#447](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/447)).
- Started working on video post-production and ideas for videos on cross-validation ([#439](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/439) and [#445](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/445)).
- Worked on gitlabs MRs [!27](https://gitlab.inria.fr/learninglab/mooc-scikit-learn/mooc-scikit-learn-coordination/-/merge_requests/27) and [!28](https://gitlab.inria.fr/learninglab/mooc-scikit-learn/mooc-scikit-learn-coordination/-/merge_requests/28)
- TODO: Work with Julien on scikit-learn PRs

### Olivier

- Continued hiring interviews, next one tonight with Guillaume
- Another round of reviews on Julien's PR and sub PRs (that are now merged)
- Reviewed cluster_qr PR [#21148](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21148)
- Replied/reviewed GaussianMixtureIC's PR [#19562](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19562)

- Reading literature to be able to reply constructively to decision_path [#19294](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/19294), Honest RFs [#19710](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/19710) and related discussions
    - reading https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01271

- Meeting with Mathis on resuming work on benchmark tools (step 1: finalize refactoring for margaret runner + fix known bugs, step 2: rapidsai)

- TODO: compare Julien's PR to cuML on margaret to help gauge the expected speed-ups of using a single GPU (+ KMeans, DBSCAN, SVMs) to get some realistic numbers
- TODO: notify the candidates that we don't keep in the short list.
- TODO: review sample props [#21284](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21284) / interaction constraints
- TODO: Release planning: 1.0.1

### Discussion

- Create official youtube channel for scikit-learn?

### TODO / Next

- Work on videos for cross-validation (Arturo)
    - Push a copy of the MOOC videos on https://www.youtube.com/user/inriachannel
