## Mathis

- Off since June 11

## Julien

  - OOB permutation importance in forest: [#18603](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18603/)

## Jérémie

- Worked on finishing `n_features_in_`: [#19333](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/19333) is closed

- Follow-up PRs
  - kPCA example: [#19945](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19945) and [#20248](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20248)

## Olivier

- configuration DNS for https://www.scikit-learn.org
- PR reviews (`n_features_in_`, `normalize` deprecation, ...)
- OVH MOOC hosting meeting
- A bit of MOOC forum follow-up
- cyclic feature engineering [#20281](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20281)
- RFC critical difference diagrams for multiple model performance comparison [#20319](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/20319): Loop with Alex Perez that worked on this subject

## Loïc

- holidays
- PRs question related:
  - More stable init in KMeans: [#20200](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20200). I still find it a bit surprising that with OpenMP parallelism you can get different results for inertia\_, should we document/mention it?
  - Availability of `sklearn` PyPI package [#8215](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/8215). Roman's suggestion to do some kind of brownout, is it worth doing something about it, maybe not ...
- Inria academy basic session next week, but no news from David Simplot so far ...

## Work on next week

### General agenda

- Ironing political issues on outsourcing computation for the MOOC to OVH (Gael)
- Organizing the future of scikit-learn@inria (Gael)
- Publish the TC notes (Guillaume (admin) - Jeremie (website))

- Julien:
  - sync with Mathis
  - will work on some smallers PR for [#20254](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20254) like [#20323](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20323)
  - some more benchmark for Cython+ and (`drago` machines have being used a lot lately)
- `feature_names` / pandas in/out (Guillaume, Olivier, ...)
- organise one geeky coffee meeting now that I have done the teaser ;-) (Loïc)
