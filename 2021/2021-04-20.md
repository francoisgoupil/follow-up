## April 20th 2021

### Mathis
- Discussed visualization of profiling results (different approaches considered) with Olivier, Jérémie and Julien. Use ui.perfetto.dev?
- Mainly refactored existing benchmarking and reporting code
- Add LogisticRegression and Ridge to benchmarks

### Guillaume
- Merged PRs: Dictionary learning (bug fixes), standard scaler (numerical issues bug fix)
- Reviewed PR: 
    - One-hot encoder infrequent categories (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16018)
    - KernelPCA: bug in `inverse_transform` and direction to improve documentation and examples
- Proposed PRs:
    - Improving KernelCenterer doc + test: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19901 -> need second approval for merging
    - Multilabels format:
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19859,
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19874,
        - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19869
    - add support for list of str in `plot_partial_dependence`: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19438
- Issues:
    - `SimpleImputer` median computation inefficient due to masked array implementation: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/19926

### Julien
 - Explored oneDAL capabilities
     - there are both algorithmic (accumulator, block-wise computations, etc.) and technical reasons (ICC, Intel's pragma, etc.) for their implementations
       to be faster 
 - Started implementing a KDTree with Cython+, had a quick talk with Xavier from Nexedi regarding their runtime for async. computations.
 - Gone through some Cython PRs
 - Worked on:
     - [19850](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19850)
     - [19883](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19883)
     - [19893](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19893)
     - [19884](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19884)
     - [17169](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17169) (needs another reviewer)
 - Reviewed a few PRs
 - Thinking of a bot to report  benchmark runs on PR when asked for
 - Going through implementations of KDTree (and associated PRs)
 - Potential room for manoeuvre (prange, nogil, sorts using `std::algorithms`, etc.)

### Jérémie
- MiniBatchNMF, try to find a good default for the batch_size
- discussions with Mathis & Julien. Benchmarks, cython,...
- talked with augustin lefevre about beta divergences in (online)NMF. Testings with a sound file.
- a bit of mooc beta testing
- needs review (Alex?) https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19210
- (MiniBatchKMeans refactor merged -> https://scikit-learn.org/scikit-learn-benchmarks/#cluster.MiniBatchKMeansBenchmark.time_fit?p-representation='dense') \o/

### Olivier
- KernelPCA related reviews:
    - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19732
    - and related (linked in previous PR)
- Working on MOOC slides / videos

### Loïc
- Inria Academy "beginner" session last week
- MOOC: beta feed-back and improvements (in principle beta is until April 27th i.e. one more week). Mostly typos or small rewordings so far ...
- MOOC: find beta-testers for later modules (most people have started at the beginning so very little feed-back on modules >= 2)

### Alex
- What's our status on normalize deprecation?
- SLEP 06 I am lost
    - (Gael: I find that the discussion is evolving)
- ANN: CDS has an engineer position!

### Discussions

- Laptops or SSH access for Mathis and Julien (needed for running benchmarks on machines with 16+ cores or GPU to bench against cuML)
- Focus on 0.24.2 issues:
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/milestones/0.24.2

##### TODO

- Release 0.24.2: Guillaume as conductor / release manager https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/milestone/42
- [SLEP01](https://scikit-learn-enhancement-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/slep001/proposal.html) : Gael
- _Comité de suivi interne Inria_ (Chiara + Gael)
- Technical committee June 2nd (Chiara)
- Fujitsu Sprint (https://www.fujitsu.com/jp/group/labs/en/about/resources/article/202104-devsprint.html)
    - Good first issue: find warnings to fix
- MiniBatchNMF (Chiara + Jeremie)
- MOOC beta (Loïc, more people more than welcome :wink:)
- MOOC slides / video (Olivier + Loïc if that helps)
