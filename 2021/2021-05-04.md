## May 4th 2021

### Chiara
- Planning the technical committee (see [here](https://gitlab.inria.fr/sklconsortium/sklconsortium/-/issues/37))
- Some interactions with numpy about documentation: I would like to propose some PRs on scikit-learn accordingly
  - [communication guidelines](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/dev/reviewer_guidelines.html#communication-guidelines)
  - markdown highlighting in [saved replies](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/tips.html?highlight=saved%20replies#standard-replies-for-reviewing)
  - Adding a note like in the [linux documentation](http://halobates.de/on-submitting-patches.pdf) perhaps
    [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html#pull-request-checklist)?
  ```
    All code in the kernel has some maintenance overhead.Once code is submitted the kernel maintainers committhemselves to keeping it functional for a long time.
    It isusually expected that the person who submits new codedoes most of the maintenance for that code at least ini-tially.
    Some of the procedures described here are actu-ally to demonstrate that the patch submitter is trustwor-thy enough and they they not just plan to
    “throw codeover the fence.”
   ```   
- towards v 1.0: [#19088](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19088) (Common Private Loss Module) will help to finalize
  [#11430](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/11430) (add guideline for choosing a scoring function), if the documentation is rendered. 

### Gael
- feedback from BCG: very happy with the interpretation workshop

### Mathis
- Some work on HistGradientBoostingClassifier benchmarks: define relevant parameters, establish correspondances and use randomized search
- Overall improvements on existing benchmarks (KNN, KMeans, Ridge, LogisticRegression)
- Spend some time with Julien discussing Cython, performance issues and low-level subjects
- Wrote some benchmarks to test new pairwise_distances and studied results with Olivier, Jérémie and Julien

### Julien
- Caught up with Xavier on Friday for experiments with Cython+
    - planned feeback sessions every 2 or 3 weeks 
- Discussions around 0.24.2 with Guillaume
- Started experimentations for a new implementation of agregations over pairwise distance with Mathis
    - onboarding Mathis on Cython with resources on low level programming
    - a new candidate implementation of KNN search is working; next steps are benchmarking it against sklearn daal4py over several `working_memory`/ `chunk_size` dimensions
    - working an adequate strategies for each scenarios 
- Followed up with a few PR reviews

### Olivier
- MOOC videos + integrating beta test feedback (fixing problematic quiz questions)

### Jérémie
- Add stopping criterion for MiniBatchDictionaryLearning (#18975). Trying to make convincing plots.
- the PRs linked in https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/19335 need review (really quick: deprecations for 1.0)

### Guillaume
- Release 0.24.2
- Project presentation linked to MOOC
- review for the MOOC
- some love given to the Gaussian processes

### Loïc
- MOOC: dealing with the beta feed-back
- MOOC: should we have quizzes named Quiz M3.02 (rather than Quiz 12) ? This is the kind of things we can change (maybe with some not so trivial work)
  in FUN-MOOC ...

### Alex
- SLEP006?
- Normalize in linear models?

### TODO / Next
- Olivier + Guillaume + Loïc: MOOC v1.0 milestone issues (mostly quiz fixing)
- Jérémie: n_features_in_ in meta-estimators ([#19333](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/19333))
- Mathis/Julien: benchmarks results for the new aggregation over pairwise distances
- Jérémie: stopping criteria for MiniBatchDictionnaryLearning
- [#19705](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/19705) (minimal scipy for version 1.0), Chiara will check the builds
- Guillaume: Gaussian process
- Start looking at sklearn 1.0 milestone / consortium priorities roadmap: Guillaume
