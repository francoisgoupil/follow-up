## March 9nd 2021

### Olivier
- [temporarily stalled for no reason] calibration / n_features_in_ validation with flexibility to accept any input (e.g. base estimator is a pipeline)
    https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19555
- Investigated what are the problems with Ridge with sample_weights: good for normalize=False but confirmed bad for normalize=True:
    https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/19615
- [WIP] to try to fix normalize=True + sample_weight sematics in all linear models but some problems remaining:
    https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19616
- Reviewed https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17772 by Maria on Ridge normalize=True deprecation.
- Small PR to add a consistency test between Ridge and ElasticNet: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19620 (waiting for review)
- Currently reviewing https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16079/files (SLEP 006 proto)
