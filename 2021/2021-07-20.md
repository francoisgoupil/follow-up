_Off Wednesday 21/07/2021_
- `sklearn_benchmarks`:
    - [ ] WIP refactoring and bug fixes
    - [ ] Adapt code to run benchmarks on Margaret
- PR [MAINT Use Tempita for WeightVector #20481](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20481):
    - WIP:
        - Write unit tests for the `WeightVector` interface (types invariance, 32-bit support)


### Julien

 - Synced with Mathis:
    - reviewed [`mbatoul/sklearn_benchmarks`](https://github.com/mbatoul/sklearn_benchmarks/)
 - Cython+
    - migrated my repos on [Nexedi's gitlab instance](https://lab.nexedi.com/jjerphan)
    - ran benchmarks for Cython+, scales better after a new patch
    - synced on a type system for reference capabilities 
    - I need to dive in the code of Cython to further contribute to Cython+
 - [#20254: `PairwiseDistancesReductions`](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20254)
     - [Benchmarks](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20254#issuecomment-882353937): improved performances but the heuristic needs calibration
     - Currently calibrating the heuristic
 - A small PR: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20535
 - Off on Friday 30th July

### Jérémie
- (tunnel vision on) MiniBatchNMF. Regularization at transform time ?
- discussion with Mathis & Julien about benchmarks.
- really need to do: review pairwise distances aggregation

### Guillaume ([My GitHub Board](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/projects/17))

- Mainly work on the plotting API:
    - ROC curve display [#20569](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20569) -> need review
    - Precision-recall curve display [#20552](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20552) -> need review
    - DET curve display [#19278](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19278) -> need review
    - Calibration plot (Lucy) [#17443](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/17443) -> my +1 and need additional review
- Partial dependence plot (PDP) for categorical variable:
    - Merged [PR](https://github.com/madhuracj/scikit-learn/pull/2) made on contributor repository
    - Adding tests and reviewing [#18298](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18298)
- Reviewed and merge PRs from contributor:
    - backlog from Data Imbrella sprint (`numpydoc` validation for estimator)
    - `feature_names` consistency -> need to check again after new discussion
    -  `sample_weight` overwritten in `isotonic_regression` [#20515](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20515)

### Loïc

- Holidays
- a bit of MOOC this morning
- can help on putting Mathis benchmarks on margaret, let me know if I can help!

### Arturo

- Started creating contents index
    - Byproduct: possibly useful for addressing issues [#332](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/332) and [#335](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/335)
- Created Proposal for reordering the contents in M1 and M2 ([#398](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/398))
    - Byproduct: potentially address the issues in [#124](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/124), [#340](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/340), [#361](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/361) and [#366](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/366)
- Follow the MOOC and corrected typos/wording on the fly
   - Byproduct: created PRs addressing issues [#351](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/351) and [#376](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/376)
