## September 7th, 2021

## Gael:

- Hiring the new community manager: job offer on the way any time soon. Be prepared to spread the information
- Contract for Mathis
- Renewal of Jérémie
- TODO: all of above + doctoral project for Alex Perez


### Olivier

- Drafted roadmap for ongoing collaboration with Mathis after end of internship
- scikit-learn 1.0 release work:
    - various milestoned PR reviews, including: extended API for ROC AUC curve [#20569](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20569) / decision boundary plots [#16061](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16061)
    - ARM CI fixes for the release:
      - circle ci-based [#20711](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20711) (single executor: too slow unfortunately)
      - travis ci-based [#20958](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20958) <- faster and should be enough credits for releasing 1.0
    - Feature names out merged in time for 1.0 [#18444](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/18444)
- Review PR julien

### Jérémie
- OpenBLAS / OpenMP performance issue. related to
  https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/issues/3187
  https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/20642
  Tried to make a pure C reproducible example. Hurt a wall when I would have needed to implement a threadpool mecanism with pthreads.
- ASV benchmarks. Now keeps the logs of the runs in the repo with additional info on the env and machine.
- helped with workaround for const memoryviews while waiting for cython 3. https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20903

### Julien
- Cython+: studying prior to next week:
    - Cython codebase structure
    - the proposed system of reference capabilities
- [#20254](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/20254):
    - Rounds of reviews
    - Add more tests
    - Compare with Scipy's distance metrics' implementations
    - Inspecting some slow benchmark cases compared to Intel's
- General triage + reviews of Pull Requests:
    - note: need decision for [#19562](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19562#pullrequestreview-714487004)

### Guillaume

- Catch up with issues/PRs trackers
- Release 1.0

### Loïc

back from holidays

### Arturo

- Finished filling [Loïc's notes extension](https://notes.inria.fr/rgSzYtubR6uSOQIfY9Fpvw#) to find questions with score under 70% (Issue [#432](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/432))
    - continued addressing easy-to-fix questions, resulting in gitlab MR [#23](https://gitlab.inria.fr/learninglab/mooc-scikit-learn/mooc-scikit-learn-coordination/-/merge_requests/23)
    - currently working on expanding the notes above 70% (issues that not relate to score)
- Continued cross-linking forum posts with issues in GitHub, resulting in [#449](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/449), [#450](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/450), [#451](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/451) and [#452](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/452)
- Currently working on presentation to discuss my experience doing the MOOC
