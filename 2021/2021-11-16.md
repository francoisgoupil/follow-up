## November 16th, 2021

### Gael

- A bit of politics with regards to the big money the governement is giving us (there will be a lot of expectation management to do here)

### Jérémie

- callback API. Snapshot callback is doable but will require a lot of work in the estimators -> requires to be able to construct an instance during the fit as if the fit was done (setting appropriate fitted attributes)
- investigate cython boundscheck behavior with slices of memoryview (related to https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21662)

### Alex

- Discussions with Sylvain Corlay and Adrin on Numfocus / sklearn collaboration. It's hard... 2 visions of the world ... lack of trust
- I'll give a talk at EDF on Dec 9 (hope is to make them contribute to the consortium...)

### Olivier

- Investigating segmentation fault in Cython code on non-memory aligned numpy buffers:
    - debug PR with experiment results [#21677](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21677)
    - related issue in joblib [joblib/joblib#563](https://github.com/joblib/joblib/issues/563)
- CI fixes and reviews


### Julien

 - Working of KDTree benchmarks for Cython+:
     - https://lab.nexedi.com/cython-plus/kdtree
 - Reviewed some (5) PRs
 - Talked with a contributor about its contributing experience
 - Attended PR[AI]RIE workshop but missed Alexandre's presentation
 - Might look at recent PRs from Christian (the ones reported by Olivier and Jérémie)
 - Willing to help on the communication and organisation sides:
     - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21287
     - https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/21689

### Arturo

- Second round of recording the video on cross-validation
- PR's [#484](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/484) and [#486](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/486) (solve several warnings)
- MR [!30](https://gitlab.inria.fr/learninglab/mooc-scikit-learn/mooc-scikit-learn-coordination/-/merge_requests/30) (question with low score)
- Issues [#485](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/485) (nice-to-have for plots) and [#487](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/issues/487) (question with low score)

### Guillaume

- Admin stuff:
    - Checking answers and set date for the Technical Committee (December, 3rd)
    - Starting presentation for Air Liquide
- Check a couple of things about the metrics in imbalanced setting

### Loïc

- [#21552](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21552) waiting for reviews (cross 32bit/64bit pickles for decision tree)
- isolation of GPUs in Margaret (in particular in interactive VSCode sessions), still not working
- need to start preparing internal Inria Academy "advanced" session begin December

### Discussion

- DataIA internship topics
- Intel extension API project for GPU
- Distribution des vouchers OVH aux apprenants

## TODO / Next

- Presentation for consortium (Guillaume)
- Feedback on MOOC PR (Arturo)
- [KDTree benchmark](https://lab.nexedi.com/cython-plus/kdtree) (Julien)
- Blog setup (Julien)
- callback API (jérémie)
- Internship topic: explainability
