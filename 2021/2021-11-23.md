### Gael

- trying to put some "oil" in Cython+: finding aligned interests and doing diplomacy between Nexedi and the Cython team

### Olivier

- Helped find a workaround for [scipy/scipy#15050](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/15050) to unblock the scipy 1.7.3 release (multiple OpenBLAS linked to Python on Apple M1)
- Ongoing MOOC PR reviews led to refactoring of the docstring of DummyClassifier [#21712](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21712)
- Fixing sklearn to deal with minkowski API change in scipy 1.8 [#21741](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21741)
- Various scikit-learn PR reviews, some need second reviewer:
    - FunctionTransformer feature names [#21569](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21569) needs second review
    - KMeans default algorithm to Lloyd instead of Elkan [#21735](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21735)
- TODO: review [GPU extension API design](https://labs.quansight.org/blog/2021/11/pydata-extensibility-vision/) by Quansight to check compat with what we had in mind for scikit-learn.
- TODO: need to prepare slides for scikit-learn in 180s for Thursday.

### Guillaume

### Arturo
- PR [#488](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/488) (Add shuffle-split diagram)
- PR [#490](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/490) and MR [!31](https://gitlab.inria.fr/learninglab/mooc-scikit-learn/mooc-scikit-learn-coordination/-/merge_requests/31) (Change question precision-recall)
- Revisit reviewed PRs [#455](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/455), [#460](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/460), [#463](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/463), [#464](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/464), [#466](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/466), [#477](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/477), [#484](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/484) and [#486](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc/pull/486)

### Loïc

- working on [#21552](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21552) (cross bitness pickle)
- discussion with Alex and Richard for a use case with Dask joblib backend. Nested parallelism, with different backends at different levels, n_jobs meaning, needs a closer look ...
