        - some CSS maintenance
        - addressed and expect additional reviews`_get_response_value` refactoring [#21538](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21538)
        - start to have small PRs linked to the refactoring of common tests.

### Julien

 - [#21462](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21462)
     - Some results of my frugal matploblib skills, putting numbers into graphs: _stonks_ confirmed by illustration
         - To put on a blog post once this is merged! [name=Gael]
     - Kéké le tuning with `perf(1)`: no problem to report
     - A few cosmetic things to get done with (still): a few new reviews (yeay!)
         - Time to get this thing merged: finalize this PR in a mergeable state, last review and merge [name=Gael]
         - [name=Julien] I agree, this took too long. We should try sticking to smaller PRs. 
 - Cython+:
     - discussing the syntax and others things (UX, actors, etc.)
     - adapting the KDTree for requests
 - Helped Arturo getting a confortable setup to work with on the long term
 - Reviewed a few PRs
 - Would like to push for Juan Martín Loyola's integration in the triage team 
 - Will be off next week

### Jérémie
- callbacks: working prototype for progressbars in meta-estimator + joblib.Parallel setting.
  Requires: Computation tree attached to estimators + background thread monitoring the progress
- playing with rich https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich. It's really cool ! I can't stop oO
- Currently making the prototype more robust in order to make a PR (but I broke it so i'm debugging...)
- Thinking about the other callbacks I made before and how to integrate them with the new design.
