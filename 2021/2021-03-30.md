## March 30th 2021

### Gael
- Talked with possible new members
- MOOC teaser

### Mathis
- Read about scikit-learn's API design + coding good practices + explored codebase
- Discussed with Jérémie and Olivier the first steps for the benchmarking framework
- Wrote a first script to benchmark KNeighborsClassifier and KMeans (+ speedups, scores differences)
- Started working on the visualization of results

### Chiara
- update the website to Inria recommendation for GDPR compliance: still WIP... but cookies have suddenly disappeared from the website.
- start the repository for the Fujitsu sprint (Norbert Preining as collaborator) https://github.com/scikit-learn-inria-fondation/FujitsuSprintMay2021/projects/1
- MiniBatchNMF : refining and benchmarks on drago3

### Guillaume
- Teaser
- Finializing the exercise of the MOOC
- Catch up with the issue tracker
- imbalanced-learn / scikit-learn => possible regression in query NN performances due to the heuristic "auto" (brute-force vs BallTree).

### Olivier
- Discussions / reviews with team members
- Finalizing calibration input validation https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19555
- Reviewed randomized solver for kernel PCA https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/12069
- Next: MOOC / follow-up PRs mentionned in team meeting yesterday

### Alex
- will have a look at normalize

### Jérémie
- follow up Mathis work
- deep dive into variance and constant features issue https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/19726
  - first, improve precision (in sparse) when real variance is 0 (avoid catastrophic cancellation) https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19766
    (under review)
  - next improve overall precision by adding a correction term to the variance (corrected 2 pass algorithm). did some tests and it's actually important
  - finally use the theoretical upper bound on the relative error of the 2 pass algorithm to decide if the variance of a feature can't be distinguished
    from 0. PR soon

### Loïc
- MOOC: teaser
- ongoing + TODO : MOOC find beta-testers, volunteering people welcome!

### TODOs:
- We need someone to tackle a revamp of the CI to bump the minimal dependencies to that of the latest ubuntu LTS (probably from conda forge)
    - Olivier will open an issue and call for volonteers (ping Juan Carlos)

- PRs needing review:
  - [PR #19088](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/19088)  from Christian (Loss function module) needs review
    (Chiara will check, good opportunity to learn, Olivier)
  - [PR #16018](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16018) (by Thomas) Infrequent categories for one hot encoder (Guillaume)
    Concern: complexity of the one hot encoder
  - PR #19041(by Thomas) Supporting drop!=None and handle_unknown='ignore'  (Guillaume, Olivier)

- Follow up on the fact that CircleCI now supports ARM (Chiara)
- MiniBatchNMF (Chiara + Jérémie)
- near constant features (Jérémie)
- Loïc + Olivier: MOOC
- Mathis : improve visualization (different splits of HP) / make plots interactive / create Github Actions workflow to automate benchmarking
  (with Olivier and Jérémie)
