### Julien

 - Started reviewing:
   - [[MRG] Online implementation of non-negative matrix factorization](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/16948)

 - Working on sub-pull-requests for the `PairwiseDistancesArgKmin`, see [the plan](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/21462#issuecomment-993862788):
     - [MAINT Introduce `PairwiseDistancesReductions` private submodule](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22064)
     - Make `PairwiseDistancesReductions` the default back-end for scikit-learn implementations
     - [MAINT Introduce `FastEuclideanPairwiseArgKmin`](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/22065)
 - Bonus track: Sporadically trying to understand [France's strategy](https://www.intelligence-artificielle.gouv.fr/fr/strategie-nationale/la-strategie-nationale-pour-l-ia), estimating the SNR.

### Jérémie
- threadpoolctl maintenance. https://github.com/joblib/threadpoolctl/pull/112
  Need to look at https://github.com/joblib/threadpoolctl/issues/110 where setting limits on openblas seems to directly impact openmp which I did not expect.
- *off next week*

### Guillaume

- Release scikit-learn 1.0.2
- Catching up with GitHub trackers
- TODO:
    - review sample-props
    - PRs + issues
    - MOOC?

### Loïc

- got involved in setuptools 60.0.0 work-arounds
- worked on cross-bitness pickles (for example [#21553](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/21553)), need to pick that up again

### Discussion

### TODO

- governance: make more explicit that after a month, no quorum is applicable (todo: Gael)
- review pairwise distances reductions (Jérémie)
- Olivier: follow-up on the contract with Intel + share info with core team
- MOOC (Olivier, Loic, Guillaume)
